# Quantum Mechanics

#### Codes and tools on quantum mechanics.

**Language/Software:** *mathematica vs 12*

#### Abstract:
Here I will post some specific codes and tools related to QM in general. I believe they could be very useful for physics students and/or for those who wants to study or teach the subject. Besides, it could help those who are interested to simulate their own quantum dynamics or visualize some specific problem.

Hope it helps and have fun!
